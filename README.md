# InstaBookRec - A Book Recommendation Algorithm for the Company Instafreebie Book Recommender

## Purpose

I am collaborating with the company instaFreebie to improve their book recommending algorithm.  I am planning to use collaborative filtering based on item-item similarity.  It has also come to my attention that my data is implicit (reccommended, clicked, downloaded) rather than explicit (user ratings of the books).
