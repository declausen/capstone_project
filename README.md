## Overview

I became a data scienctist because I wanted to use my talents to help companies succeed.  This is why I decided to work with a company for my capstone project at [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com).  

For my project I collaborated with the company [Instafreebie](https://www.instafreebie.com) to improve their book recommendation algorithm.  Instafreebie seeks to connect authors with the right readers by offering a platform for authors to distribute their work electronically and expand their readership through sharing portions of their work in exchange for email sign-ups.  

When a book is downloaded, three new books are recommended to the reader.  Good book recommendations are important for Instafreebie because they help drive their business. Better recommendations result in more downloads, which connect authors to new readers and create more business for Instafreebie.  Their algorithm was self described as "naive" because it made recommendations based solely on genre.

I utilized the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm in GraphLab Create and Spark to construct two different model-based collaborative filtering recommender systems.  



My data is implicit (reccommended, clicked, downloaded) rather than explicit (user ratings of the books).

</div><br>

I am a Data Scientist living in Denver, Colorado. I believe in harnessing the power of computers to derive actionable insights from data in order to make more informed business decisions.

I graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder with a degree in Mathematics.  I spent 3 years working as the Head of Human Resources and Accounts Receivable/Payable Manager for Smiley Inc., a small construction company in Boulder that specializes in historic remodels and renovations.

At Galvanize, I advanced my skills in machine learning, statistical analysis, and computer programming.  I seek to fully utilize my abilities as a data scientist and mathematician in order to be a useful and effective member of a company.
