## Purpose

I became a data scienctist because I believe in harnessing the power of computers to derive actionable insights from data in order to make more informed business decisions.  I seek to fully utilize my abilities as a data scientist and mathematician in order to be a useful and effective member of a company.  This is why I decided to work with a company for my capstone project at [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com).  

For my project I collaborated with the company [Instafreebie](https://www.instafreebie.com).  Instafreebie connects authors with the right readers by enabling authors to share portions of their work in exchange for email sign ups.


I used collaborative filtering based on .  It has also come to my attention that my data is implicit (reccommended, clicked, downloaded) rather than explicit (user ratings of the books).
