- used collaborative filtering, pyspark, mlllib and ALS
- trained his model on an Elastic Map Reduce cluster hosted on Amazon Web Services
- "Although I did not take this approach, a potentially better approach of developing the model would be to minimize the error between the values corresponding to a user's top n recommended artists, and the actual values for those artists for that user, for each user. This could be considered a better approach because we are only evaluating the effectiveness of our approximation on recommendations that we care about, i.e. the ones the user sees."
- "precomputed the cosine similarities for each artist relative to the rest of the artists on their feature vectors. Given this matrix, I take the queried artist and return the n most similar artists to that artist by their cosine similarity scores, 1 being very similar, 0 being not similar at all"

From Scrum
- look into side-loading

Online Research
- Similarities:
    *Jaccard - typically used where we donâ€™t have a numeric rating but just a boolean value like a product being bought or an add being clicked (or Tanimoto Coefficient)(AB / ( A + B - AB))

'''
    from math import*
    def jaccard_similarity(x,y):

        intersection_cardinality = len(set.intersection(*[set(x), set(y)]))
        union_cardinality = len(set.union(*[set(x), set(y)]))
    return intersection_cardinality/float(union_cardinality)

    *Cosine - maybe use clicked books as a different rating, and recommended but not clicked as another rating
